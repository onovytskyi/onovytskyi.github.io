	"content": " Breaking down barriers Author: Matt \u0026ldquo;MJP\u0026rdquo; Pettineo\nThe series going from the very basics of what actually barrier is right to the specifics of how barriers work on modern GPUs.\n If you’ve done any amount of D3D12 or Vulkan programming, then you’ve probably spent a good bit of that time grappling with barriers. They can be pretty tricky to get right: the validation layers seem to be always pointing out new issues whenever you change some rendering code, or when a new version of the validation layer comes in through Windows Update. And on top of that the IHV’s keep telling you that you need to be really careful and how you use barriers if you want GPU performance to meet or exceed what you get from D3D11, which is an additional challenge on top of simply achieving artifact-free results.\n \rPart 1\r\r\rPart 2\r\r\rPart 3\r\r\rPart 4\r\r\rPart 5\r\r\rPart 1\r\r\rPart 2\r\r\rPart 3\r\r\rPart 4\r\r\rPart 5\r\r"
